### Google Colab
To use the code in Google Colab:
1. Download the required `Dataset-SA.csv` dataset file
2. Download the required `I_320D_Flipkart_Product_Review_Analysis.ipynb` code file
3. Import the interactive python notebook into Colab
4. Import dataset file into Google Colab's files
5. Run the file, and make sure to uncomment the pip installs in code block 1 and 28

### Jupyter Notebook
1. Download the required `Dataset-SA.csv` dataset file
2. Download the required `I_320_Flipkart_Product_Review_Analysis.ipynb` code file
3. Download either environment.yml or library_requirements.txt to have the correct environment.
4. For either file, use conda create -n <env_name> -f <file.extension>
5. Import the dataset and code files into a directory
6. Run the file as is.
